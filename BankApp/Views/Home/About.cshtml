    Net Bank is a sample application that demonstrates 
    how to use Entity Framework 6 in an ASP.NET MVC 5 web 
    application.

    In this project, I uses code first method, then uses
    migration files to create the table in my database.
    According to the existing model, controller and view 
    are automatically generated by the "MVC 5 controller 
    with views, using Entity Framework".Finally, I modified 
    index to make sure every customer only can see their 
    own infomation based on authentication and authorization.
